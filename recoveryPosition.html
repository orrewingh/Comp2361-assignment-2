<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:bold">The recovery position</li>
	<h3>For a Baby</h3>
	<p>Cradle the baby in your arms with their head tilted downwards. Holding them in this position will keep their airway open and stop them choking on their tongue or breathing in any vomit</p>
	<h3>For an Adult</h3>
	<p>Place their arm nearest you at a right angle to their body, with their palm facing upwards</p>
	<p>Take their other arm and place it across their chest so the back of their hand is against their cheek nearest you, and hold it there</p>
	<p>With your other hand, lift their far knee and pull it up until their foot is flat on the floor. Now you’re ready to roll them onto their side. Carefully pull on their bent knee and roll them towards you. Once you’ve done this, the top arm should be supporting the head and the bent leg should be on the floor to stop them from rolling over too far.</p>
	<h3>If you suspect spinal injury</h3>
	<p>To open their airway, instead of tilting their neck, use the jaw thrust technique: Place your hands on either side of their face. With your fingertips gently lift the jaw to open the airway, avoid moving their neck</p>
	<p>To roll them onto their side, use the normal technique but do your best to keep their spine as straight as you can. If possible, get up to four helpers, two on each side, to help you keep their head, upper body and legs in a straight line at all times as you roll the body over.</p>
